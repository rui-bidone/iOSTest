## Welcome to the Bidone iOS Coding Test!

# iOS
Create a simple application with the list of orders from viewModel and display them in a list.  When a user selects a order they will be shown a second screen that will display a more detailed view of the order with view of products. 

We have given you some code over here to start with. Please clone/fork this repository. 


## Specification
- Consume the orders data from the viewModel  
- Display data in a sorted list 
- Open a detailed view when user selects a list item

Please commit frequently to communicate your throughts while working on this assignment.

## What is valued 
- Best practice design patterns 
- Clean Code 

## Nice to have (If you have time)
- Unit and UI Tests
- Calculate how much GST was paid on each order.  GST is 15%.  It is up to you to choose the most appropriate place to display GST

## Duration 
Try not to spend more than 4 hours on this.  You are not necessarily expected to do everything in this assignment because of the short duration. 

## Tech 
- Native iOS frameworks only (no Flutter sorry) 
- Use whatever libraries you are comfortable with
